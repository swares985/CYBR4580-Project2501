# Progress Report (insert date here)
## Overview
Our group has been building off our findings from milestone two. We have been exploring using interceptors within java code to help with the JVM security, and the issue that it is possible to create a memory dump that would save entries that were typed into fields. (such as usernames and passwords) We explored different options of remediated this problem, such as using interceptors or good coding practices. We believe that through our work and research we can help the information security world reach a higher level of protection.

## Hinderances
I feel that a serious challenged we faced was group coordination and finding time for use to meet and discuss the different things we have worked on, so we could properly coordinate our different findings. Also, with the semester winding down, a lot of work needs to be done in other classes and on other projects, so finding times where we could meet up for even just a little bit gets a little more difficult. Luckily, strong leadership was able to pull us together and set out times for us to get our much-needed work and collaboration done. 

Once again, some other hindrances we ran into was the lack of prior work into this specific problem. It increases work time by a drastic amount. It also leads us to a better understanding of the problem and of any solutions we would provide. It did provide us with a learning experience by working through the problems encountered.
