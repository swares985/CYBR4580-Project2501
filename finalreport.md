# Project2501
## Executive Summary
(overview of project, reuse from milestone 1, update if scope changed)
## Project Goals
From the first milestone till the time of the final milestone was deliverable for this project the team members maintained the following goals for the project:

•	Develop a heap program to test Java 7 Enterprise Editions memory management procedures and record the development in the result to maintain the progress. 
•	Determine the amount of time that JVM will keep application information in its memory for the Java 7 Enterprise Edition.
•	Determine if any improvements can be made to the Java 7 Enterprise Edition memory management procedures through faster memory deletion, or through handling sensitive data in a different way.
•	Determine the main security issues with the JVM GC and test them. 
•	Analyzing the performance of Oracle's HotSpot Java Virtual Machine.
•	Determine whether or not the JVM GC adequately handles marking potentially sensitive data as free/releasable as soon as possible.

## Project Methodology
To maintain successful and keep on track with the project timeline we are going to use mercurial version control system to work together, the development will remain synchronized with everyone participating in the development process. At each stage of the process there will be peer to peer code reviews and tests on everyone’s machines to make sure the output matches and no anomalies exists.

Officially, this project will follow an agile/kanban mashup flow of work, where work to be completed is prioritized by the teams in communication with instructors. As time and resources become available, team members may take on tasks from a prioritized backlog and begin working, without regard to specific metrics dates (besides required Milestone deliverables). To help keep team members on track and up-to-date on team progress, the team has created and uses the GroupMe mobile application. It is available in a web client and as an application for all major phone operating systems. In addition, its simplicity avoids many causes for roadblocks due to teammember confusion when navigating more feature-heavy applications (e.g. Slack). When official or documentable correspondance is required, email will be the primary form of communication.
Development will take place using the IDE of choice by each team member (including Eclipse, Netbeans, and IntelliJ), provided each IDE is configured to style source code files identically, and each IDE supports version control integration with Git. All written documentation (including source code) will be compiled into the Git repository this README is present on, and will be updated regularly for all members. Team members have committed to maintaining good habits for using version control systems, and will be granted Contributor status within the Github project by the project owner (Shawn Ware) as appropriate. Source files for any programs written will be kept in seperate directories from documentation files.
A VPS solution, owned by Shawn, will be used, along with Apache Tomcat and Oracle's Java EE, to host a proof-of-concept application for research purposes. Team members have access controls in place to ensure accountability. SSH control of the VPS is held exclusively by Shawn for privacy purposes. Team members should not require SSH access to the VPS, though arrangements can be made if such situations present.
Remote debugging of the application (really, java heap and stack analysis) will be performed through a variety of applications, including JRocket, JVisualVM, and others as researched and deemed appropriate. More information on the specifications and capabilities of each application is required before a full list can be prepared.
Team members divide the work of each milestone deliverable based on the interest of each member to maintain a good quality of the work.
The team maintained a regular meeting time during the class time either with the instructor or between team members to discuss the progress of the team work and what be needed to be done for each milestone deliverable.
